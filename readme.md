# Predict Handwritten Digits

This is a mini project based on two pre-trained models Linear and Convolutional neural networks, and perform predictions in real time according to a draw area where you can draw the digit using the mouse.

# Getting started

**IMPORTANT: Before starting you have to train the models, check `linear-model` and `convolutional-model` readmes in `python` folder.**

## Step 1

`clone` the project in your computer and `cd` into it.

## Step 2

Install maven dependencies by runing `mvn install`

## Step 3

Replace the paths to models, by replacing `PATH_TO_LINEAR_MODEL` and `PATH_TO_CONVOLUTIONAL_MODEL` static variables in the Board class located in `src/main/java/gui/Board.java`

## Step 4

Launch the main function located in the Board class `src/main/java/gui/Board.java`
